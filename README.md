# Favlist

A plugin for PC Beat Saber that can create a playlist of your favorited songs from an in-game menu.

## Usage

You can find the Favlist menu from the player settings screen on the left-hand side of song selection, under the mods tab.

> [!TIP]
> In order to use playlists in game, you need to install a mod that handles them such as [PlaylistManager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager).

There are some settings that you can change to control what goes into the favorites playlist:

- Whether the mod should overwrite the existing Favlist file or create new ones;
- Whether to include favorite Work-In-Progress (WIP) songs in the playlist;
- Whether to exclude custom songs that do not exist on [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) (Requires [SongDetailsCache](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_SongDetails) to work).

> [!NOTE]
> PlaylistManager does not show WIP songs in playlists

## Manual Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to BSIPA, you must have [SongCore](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore), [SiraUtil](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil), and [BeatSaberMarkupLanguage](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) installed for this mod to load. Install them using your mod manager i.e. [BSManager](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#bsmanager).

Place the contents of the zip file from the latest [release](https://github.com/qqrz997/Favlist/releases/latest) into your Beat Saber installation folder. If you need more information regarding manual installation of mods [this wiki page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation) will help. For further help with installing mods, join the [Beat Saber Modding Group](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) discord server.

### With BSManager

Drag and drop the zip file file into the mods tab BSManager. If the prompt for dragging and dropping does not appear, you can try using the "Import mods" button by clicking the download icon in the bottom right corner. This will bring up a file browser prompt where you can select the zip file.

Older versions of Favlist are not supported. If you find issues using an older version then I won't be able to help.
